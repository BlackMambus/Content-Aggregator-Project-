# Content-Aggregator-Project-

A content aggregator is a platform or system that automatically collects, organizes, and displays information from various sources around the internet. Instead of browsing multiple websites, users can get curated content in one convenient place—whether it's news articles, blog posts, videos, podcasts, or social media updates.

⚙️ How It Works:
Sources: Pulls data from RSS feeds, APIs, websites, or social media platforms.

Aggregation Logic: Filters by topics, keywords, or user preferences.

Presentation: Displays content in a feed, grid, or magazine-like layout—often with summaries, images, and links.
